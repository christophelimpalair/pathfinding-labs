## Objective

Your objective is to learn how to exploit a privilege escalation vulnerability that allows you to move from the `pl-prod-ecs-004-to-admin-starting-user` IAM user to the `pl-prod-ecs-004-to-admin-target-role` administrative role by registering a malicious ECS task definition with the admin role as the task execution role and running the task on AWS Fargate to attach `AdministratorAccess` to the starting user.

- **Start:** `arn:aws:iam::{account_id}:user/pl-prod-ecs-004-to-admin-starting-user`
- **Destination resource:** `arn:aws:iam::{account_id}:role/pl-prod-ecs-004-to-admin-target-role`

### Starting Permissions

**Required** (`pl-prod-ecs-004-to-admin-starting-user`):
- `iam:PassRole` on `arn:aws:iam::*:role/pl-prod-ecs-004-to-admin-target-role` -- pass the admin role to the ECS task definition
- `ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition` on `*` -- register a task definition specifying the admin role and attacker command
- `ecs:RunTask` on `*` -- launch the registered task on AWS Fargate

**Helpful** (`pl-prod-ecs-004-to-admin-starting-user`):
- `ecs:DescribeTasks` -- monitor task execution status and verify task completion
- `ecs:DeregisterTaskDefinition` -- clean up task definition after demonstration
- `ecs:StopTask` -- stop running tasks during cleanup
- `ec2:DescribeVpcs` -- find Pathfinding VPC for ECS task network configuration
- `ec2:DescribeSubnets` -- find subnet in Pathfinding VPC for ECS task network configuration
- `iam:DetachUserPolicy` -- remove admin policy from starting user during cleanup
- `iam:ListAttachedUserPolicies` -- verify privilege escalation success by listing attached policies

## Self-hosted Lab Setup

### Prerequisites

1. Install the `plabs` CLI:
   ```bash
   brew tap DataDog/pathfinding-labs https://github.com/DataDog/pathfinding-labs
   brew install DataDog/pathfinding-labs/plabs
   ```
   Or with Go 1.25+ installed:
   ```bash
   go install github.com/DataDog/pathfinding-labs/cmd/plabs@latest
   ```
2. Configure your AWS profiles in `~/.plabs/plabs.yaml` (or run `plabs init` if you haven't already)

### Deploy with plabs non-interactive

```bash
plabs enable ecs-004-to-admin
plabs apply
```

### Deploy with plabs tui

1. Launch the TUI: `plabs`
2. Navigate to `ecs-004-to-admin` in the scenarios list
3. Press `space` to enable it
4. Press `a` to apply

## Attack

### Scenario Specific Resources Created

| ARN | Purpose |
| -- | -- |
| `arn:aws:iam::{account_id}:user/pl-prod-ecs-004-to-admin-starting-user` | Scenario-specific starting user with access keys and ECS permissions |
| `arn:aws:iam::{account_id}:role/pl-prod-ecs-004-to-admin-target-role` | Admin role that can be passed to ECS tasks (trusts ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com) |
| `arn:aws:ecs:{region}:{account_id}:cluster/pl-prod-ecs-004-cluster` | ECS cluster for running Fargate tasks |
| `arn:aws:ssm:{region}:{account_id}:parameter/pathfinding-labs/flags/ecs-004-to-admin` | SSM parameter containing the CTF flag (readable with AdministratorAccess) |

### Solution

For a narrative, step-by-step walkthrough of this attack (CTF writeup style), see:

[Solution](solution.md)

### Automated Demo

#### Executing the automated demo_attack script

The script will:
1. Display a step-by-step walkthrough with color-coded output
2. Show the commands being executed and their results
3. Verify successful privilege escalation
4. Capture the CTF flag from SSM Parameter Store using the newly gained admin credentials


#### Resources Created by Attack Script

- ECS task definition registered with admin target role
- ECS Fargate task launched to execute privilege escalation
- `AdministratorAccess` policy attached to the starting user

#### With plabs non-interactive

```bash
plabs demo --list
plabs demo ecs-004-iam-passrole+ecs-registertaskdefinition+ecs-runtask
```

#### With plabs tui

1. Launch the TUI: `plabs`
2. Navigate to `ecs-004-to-admin` in the scenarios list
3. Press `r` to run the demo script

### Cleanup

#### With plabs non-interactive

```bash
plabs cleanup --list
plabs cleanup ecs-004-iam-passrole+ecs-registertaskdefinition+ecs-runtask
```

#### With plabs tui

1. Launch the TUI: `plabs`
2. Navigate to `ecs-004-to-admin` in the scenarios list
3. Press `c` to run the cleanup script

## Teardown

### Teardown with plabs non-interactive

```bash
plabs disable ecs-004-to-admin
plabs apply
```

### Teardown with plabs tui

1. Launch the TUI: `plabs`
2. Navigate to `ecs-004-to-admin` in the scenarios list
3. Press `space` to disable it
4. Press `D` to destroy

## Defend

### Detecting Misconfiguration (CSPM)

#### What CSPM tools should detect

- IAM user has `iam:PassRole` permission granting the ability to pass an administrative role to ECS tasks
- IAM user has `ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition` and `ecs:RunTask` permissions, enabling container-based privilege escalation
- Privilege escalation path: starting user can register task definitions with the admin target role and run tasks to gain admin access
- ECS cluster configured to accept Fargate tasks with no restrictions on task execution role permissions

#### Prevention Recommendations

- Restrict `iam:PassRole` permissions using resource-based conditions to limit which roles can be passed and to which AWS services
- Implement condition keys like `iam:PassedToService` with value `ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com` to explicitly control PassRole usage
- Avoid granting broad `ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition` and `ecs:RunTask` permissions; use resource tags or naming patterns to limit task operations
- Implement Service Control Policies (SCPs) that prevent passing roles with administrative permissions to ECS tasks
- Use IAM Access Analyzer to identify privilege escalation paths involving PassRole combined with ECS operations
- Enable AWS Config rules to detect ECS task definitions with overly permissive execution roles
- Implement IAM permission boundaries on users to limit the maximum permissions that can be attached

### Detecting Abuse (CloudSIEM)

#### CloudTrail Events to Monitor

- `ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition` -- new or updated task definition registered; inspect `taskRoleArn` and `executionRoleArn` in request parameters — a privileged role ARN in either field is the CloudTrail signal for PassRole to ECS; critical when the role has elevated permissions
- `ecs:RunTask` -- ECS task launched; high severity when combined with a privileged task execution role
- `iam:AttachUserPolicy` -- policy attached to a user; critical when `AdministratorAccess` is attached and the principal is an ECS task role

#### Detonation logs

_Detonation log integration (Stratus Red Team / Grimoire) is planned for a future release._
