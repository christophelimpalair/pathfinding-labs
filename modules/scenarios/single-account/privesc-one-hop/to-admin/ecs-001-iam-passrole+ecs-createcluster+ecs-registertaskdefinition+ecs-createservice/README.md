## Objective

Your objective is to learn how to exploit a privilege escalation vulnerability that allows you to move from the `pl-prod-ecs-001-to-admin-starting-user` IAM user to the `pl-prod-ecs-001-to-admin-target-role` administrative role by creating an ECS cluster, registering a task definition with the privileged role via `iam:PassRole`, and deploying a Fargate service that runs a container which attaches `AdministratorAccess` to the starting user.

- **Start:** `arn:aws:iam::{account_id}:user/pl-prod-ecs-001-to-admin-starting-user`
- **Destination resource:** `arn:aws:iam::{account_id}:role/pl-prod-ecs-001-to-admin-target-role`

### Starting Permissions

**Required** (`pl-prod-ecs-001-to-admin-starting-user`):
- `ecs:CreateCluster` on `*` -- create a new ECS cluster to host the malicious Fargate service
- `iam:PassRole` on `arn:aws:iam::*:role/pl-prod-ecs-001-to-admin-target-role` -- pass the privileged target role to the ECS task definition
- `ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition` on `*` -- register a task definition that references the privileged role
- `ecs:CreateService` on `*` -- deploy a persistent Fargate service that executes the malicious task

**Helpful** (`pl-prod-ecs-001-to-admin-starting-user`):
- `ec2:DescribeVpcs` -- find the Pathfinding VPC for ECS service network configuration
- `ec2:DescribeSubnets` -- find subnets in the Pathfinding VPC for Fargate awsvpc networking
- `ecs:DescribeServices` -- monitor service status and verify service creation
- `ecs:DescribeTasks` -- monitor task execution status and verify task completion
- `ecs:ListTasks` -- list tasks in the cluster to get the task ARN for monitoring
- `iam:ListAttachedUserPolicies` -- verify privilege escalation success by listing attached policies

## Self-hosted Lab Setup

### Prerequisites

1. Install the `plabs` CLI:
   ```bash
   brew tap DataDog/pathfinding-labs https://github.com/DataDog/pathfinding-labs
   brew install DataDog/pathfinding-labs/plabs
   ```
   Or with Go 1.25+ installed:
   ```bash
   go install github.com/DataDog/pathfinding-labs/cmd/plabs@latest
   ```
2. Configure your AWS profiles in `~/.plabs/plabs.yaml` (or run `plabs init` if you haven't already)

### Deploy with plabs non-interactive

```bash
plabs enable ecs-001-to-admin
plabs apply
```

### Deploy with plabs tui

1. Launch the TUI: `plabs`
2. Navigate to `ecs-001-to-admin` in the scenarios list
3. Press `space` to enable it
4. Press `a` to apply

## Attack

### Scenario Specific Resources Created

| ARN | Purpose |
| -- | -- |
| `arn:aws:iam::{account_id}:user/pl-prod-ecs-001-to-admin-starting-user` | Scenario-specific starting user with access keys and ECS permissions |
| `arn:aws:iam::{account_id}:role/pl-prod-ecs-001-to-admin-target-role` | Target role with AdministratorAccess policy that can be passed to ECS tasks |
| `arn:aws:ssm:{region}:{account_id}:parameter/pathfinding-labs/flags/ecs-001-to-admin` | CTF flag stored in SSM Parameter Store; retrievable by any admin-equivalent principal |

### Solution

For a narrative, step-by-step walkthrough of this attack (CTF writeup style), see:

[Solution](solution.md)

### Automated Demo

#### Executing the automated demo_attack script

The script will:
1. Display a step-by-step walkthrough with color-coded output
2. Show the commands being executed and their results
3. Create an ECS cluster and deploy a malicious service
4. Wait for the task to execute and grant administrative access
5. Verify successful privilege escalation
6. Capture the CTF flag from SSM Parameter Store using the newly gained admin permissions


#### Resources Created by Attack Script

- ECS cluster created for hosting the malicious service
- ECS task definition registered with the privileged target role
- ECS Fargate service deployed to execute the malicious task
- AdministratorAccess policy attached to the starting user

#### With plabs non-interactive

```bash
plabs demo --list
plabs demo ecs-001-iam-passrole+ecs-createcluster+ecs-registertaskdefinition+ecs-createservice
```

#### With plabs tui

1. Launch the TUI: `plabs`
2. Navigate to `ecs-001-to-admin` in the scenarios list
3. Press `r` to run the demo script

### Cleanup

#### With plabs non-interactive

```bash
plabs cleanup --list
plabs cleanup ecs-001-iam-passrole+ecs-createcluster+ecs-registertaskdefinition+ecs-createservice
```

#### With plabs tui

1. Launch the TUI: `plabs`
2. Navigate to `ecs-001-to-admin` in the scenarios list
3. Press `c` to run the cleanup script

## Teardown

### Teardown with plabs non-interactive

```bash
plabs disable ecs-001-to-admin
plabs apply
```

### Teardown with plabs tui

1. Launch the TUI: `plabs`
2. Navigate to `ecs-001-to-admin` in the scenarios list
3. Press `space` to disable it
4. Press `D` to destroy

## Defend

### Detecting Misconfiguration (CSPM)

#### What CSPM tools should detect

- **Privilege Escalation Path**: User with `iam:PassRole` + `ecs:CreateCluster` + `ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition` + `ecs:CreateService` can escalate to administrative access
- **Overly Permissive PassRole**: IAM user can pass roles with administrative privileges to ECS services
- **Unrestricted ECS Creation**: User can create ECS clusters and services without resource restrictions
- **Service PassRole Risk**: Combination of service creation permissions (ECS) with ability to pass privileged roles
- **Fargate Service Deployment**: User can deploy containerized workloads with privileged execution roles

#### Prevention Recommendations

- Implement strict resource-based conditions on `iam:PassRole` to limit which roles can be passed: `"Condition": {"StringEquals": {"iam:PassedToService": "ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com"}}`
- Add resource constraints to `iam:PassRole` to prevent passing administrative roles: `"Resource": "arn:aws:iam::*:role/AppSpecificRole*"`
- Use Service Control Policies (SCPs) to prevent creation of ECS clusters in unauthorized accounts or regions
- Implement tag-based access control requiring specific tags on roles before they can be passed to ECS services
- Enable MFA requirements for ECS service creation operations using condition keys like `aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent`
- Use IAM Access Analyzer to identify privilege escalation paths involving ECS PassRole permissions
- Restrict task execution roles to least privilege — avoid attaching AdministratorAccess to roles used by ECS tasks
- Implement automated alerting on ECS service creation events that pass privileged roles using EventBridge

### Detecting Abuse (CloudSIEM)

#### CloudTrail Events to Monitor

- `ecs:CreateCluster` -- new ECS cluster created; high severity when followed by task definition registration and service creation
- `ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition` -- new task definition registered; inspect `taskRoleArn` and `executionRoleArn` in request parameters — a privileged role ARN in either field is the CloudTrail signal for PassRole to ECS; high severity when the role has administrative permissions
- `ecs:CreateService` -- ECS service created; high severity when service uses a task definition with a privileged role and Fargate launch type

#### Detonation logs

_Detonation log integration (Stratus Red Team / Grimoire) is planned for a future release._
