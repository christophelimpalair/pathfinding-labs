# iam-passrole+ecs-starttask+ecs-registercontainerinstance privilege escalation scenario
#
# Based on: https://labs.reversec.com/posts/2025/08/another-ecs-privilege-escalation-path
#
# This scenario demonstrates how an attacker with RCE on an EC2 instance can
# escalate to admin if the instance role has ecs:RegisterContainerInstance,
# ecs:StartTask, iam:PassRole, and ecs:DeregisterContainerInstance.
#
# The starting principal is the EC2 instance role. The attacker (with RCE):
# 1. Retrieves instance identity document + signature from IMDS
# 2. Calls ecs:RegisterContainerInstance directly via the API to register
#    the EC2 to the target ECS cluster
# 3. Reconfigures the ECS agent to join the cluster (so it can execute tasks)
# 4. Calls ecs:StartTask with --overrides to override the taskRoleArn (passing
#    the admin role) and the container command
# 5. The overridden command attaches AdministratorAccess to the instance role
# 6. The EC2 instance now has admin access
#
# The demo uses SSM SendCommand to simulate RCE (initial access to the EC2).
# SSM is NOT part of the attack permissions - it's a lab simulation mechanism.

# Resource naming convention: pl-prod-ecs-007-to-admin-{resource-type}
# ecs-007 = Pathfinding.cloud ID for this scenario
